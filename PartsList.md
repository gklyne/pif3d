# Introduction #

This page is for listing where to source RepRap parts for UK printers

# Shopping List (Mendel) #

Our latest updated lists of parts we have purchased are in the [downloads tab of this site](http://code.google.com/p/pif3d/downloads/list?q=label:PartsList).

Also please see the below comments section for latest updates on acquiring parts.

The RepRap site has a Bill of Materials for Mendel: http://reprap.org/wiki/Mendel_assembly_data_sheet (download the spreadsheet, and note that it contains several pages).

# Suppliers we have used #

  * Farnel Electronic Components - (not the cheapest, but having lots from one source): M8 threaded rod, M8 stainless steel rod, toothed belts, hex head screws, nuts, washers, etc. (((TODO: add parts list from order)))
  * An alternative source for M8 threaded rod, and some of the other hardware, is Screwfix. (Just don't search for "studding": look for "threaded rod")
  * Zapp Automation (http://www.slidesandballscrews.com/) - stepper motors.  Also have a range of aluminium clamps that some have used in hot-end assemblies.
  * Park Industrial Supplies (eBay supplier: http://stores.ebay.co.uk/ParkIndustrial-Supplies) - bearings.  Good deals for packs of 10-off 624, packs of 4-off 608.
  * A promising source for electronics and special parts: http://www.mendel-parts.com/.  I (GK) have used them - and the parts they supply are pretty good.  They are, however, a small operation who appear to be overwhelmed by demand at times, so be prepared to be patient.  Their PLA is better value than some suppliers, if part of a larger order.  Elsewhere on this site ([Skeinforge\_Gen6\_Tuning](Skeinforge_Gen6_Tuning.md)) there are notes for getting a RepRap running with their "Gen6" integrated electronics.
  * http://www.fasteners.ltd.uk/ - Acorn Fasteners Ltd - are cheaper for allen-head screws - e.g. for M3x30 zinc, £5.80/100 compared with £9/100 from Farnell.  Also have wider range of sizes, and more specialist parts like large-diameter washers.
  * http://thingfarm.org/product.php?id_product=24 - showed up in my search for timing belts.  They make a nice "J-head" hot-end assembly that I'm using in my RepRap.

# Suppliers to consider #

  * http://www.beltingonline.com/ - supply syncroflex T5 drive belts in 5mm width.  Surprisingly, the price is proportional to width.  When cutting down a 10mm belt, there is a "step" in the belt edge where the reinforcing wire crosses from one side to the other, which I'd expect to be avoided if buying a belt manufactured to 5mm width.

# Cut studding and bar lengths #

There's a bill of materials spreadsheet on the RepRap site which has the measurements...
