Come one, come all and MAKE!  This day long workshop on 3D printing will explore the potential of at-home-desktop-3D-printing - that's right, just like you have paper printer sitting next to your desk at home you can now also have a 3D printer!  Why would you want a 3D printer?  Well other than the ultimate DIY machine for all those random hacks around home, is the capability of printing up another 3D printer for a friend - lightbulb: self replication (queue Terminator music...)!

Loose Agenda for the Day-long Workshop: The morning will begin with a general overview of 3D printing, we'll be working with a hobbyist 3D printer called the RepRap and we'll provide a landscape of the both the tools as well as communities you can get involved with so you can find a friend to print you the parts for your own 3D printer.  By mid morning will split up into two groups.  Group 1 (lead by David and Steven) will be for those new to 3D printing, we'll walk you through the basics of how to use Google Sketchup to draw 3D parts, how those parts are rendered out to STL files and then how the STL file is configured for the 3D printer via SkeinForge.  Group 2 (lead by Graham and Ben) will be for those of you who have done 3D printing before and will go into more advanced topics such as using OpenSCAD and Blender to make more intricate and complicated parts, including modifying parts so you can 'pimp your printer' (mutation between the generations!).  We'll spend the majority of the afternoon in these groups, however we'll all meet back up at the very end to talk about what we did in our groups.  Everyone will need to give a minute chat about what they designed or learned and what they plan to do next.

So in summary, by the end of the day you should: a.) feel confident that you know what communities to get involved with so you can get your own parts to build your own 3D printer, b.) understand the tools, suppliers and skills you will need to actually build your printer, and c.) have a bunch of great ideas for what can be printed on a 3D printer (and ideally have a couple of 3D models that are ready for printing).
