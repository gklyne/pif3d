# Introduction #

A weakness of the RepRap standrd process is that it's not well suited for working with metals.

I was thinking of manufacturing processes for making, say, metal flags for RepRap endstops, and it occurred to me that spark erosion (sometimes used for making plastic moulds for injection moulding, I understand) might be an interesting option.

This page has notes and links from some preliminary investigations.

# Notes #

  * EDM = _Electrical Discharge_ Machining, aka spark erosion
  * ECM = _Electro-Chemical_ Machining: a kind of inverse electroplating.

  * http://reprap.org/wiki/Electrochemical_Machining - I'm obviously not the first to think of this :)
    * uses brine for electrolyte - poor results, but better at lower concetrations
      * Thought: is brine the **opposite** of what's needed here?  Rather than a conductor (which brine is), I think an insulator is needed;  erosion takes place in the vicinity of dialectric breakdown.  Oil?  Ah, this is the difference between ECM and EDM.
