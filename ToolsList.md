# Essential tools #
This is per build team of 2 people per team:
  * 2.5mm Allen Keys & 6mm socket
    * for the M3 bolts
  * 3mm Allen key & 7mm socket
    * for the M4 bolts
  * 2 X 13mm spanner
    * For the frame building (and some of the main Axis Assemblies:
  * stanley knife
    * for peeling off rafts from base of printed objects (if parts have been printed with raft)
  * belt splitter
    * for slitting gear belts
    * use blade from Stanley knife
  * tape measure
  * super glue
    * attaching plastic "S" springs to base and attaching a logo to the machine (can use heated knife as well to attach plastic.
    * Also recommended for improving bond between hub and teeth on toothed belt drive gears, especially the driven gears on the Z-axis lead screws.  #g
    * Also, generally, for clamped printed pieces where the outer "shell" may tend to separate from the infill material.  Probably not a problem when the print quality is well-tuned. #g.
  * thin string
    * for calibrating triangle alignment of frame
  * nail varnish or lock tite
    * for tightening nuts/bolts (if not using Nylock nuts),
  * silicon grease
    * for metal poles that objects move across with bearings
  * spirit level (this may be an app on your iPhone/Android)
    * for calibrating the frame and print bed platform
  * course round file ~5mmm
    * for clearing out holes on uneven pieces
    * (I prefer to use a cordless drill and appropriate bit - typically 8mm or 4mm.  It is just about possible to turn a drill bit by hand for this. #g.)
  * flat file
    * for smoothing uneven pieces
  * hack saw
    * for cutting threaded and round bar
  * multi-meter
    * for testing power into arduino set.
