David gave away his 3D printer to Joss Winn at Lincolon University where they have committed to the following as part of the pif3D party scheme:
  1. You must promise to build a second printer and give that away to someone else for free (using the same conditions as these) - trying to pay it forward.  There are no time constraints and nothing to sign, just a promise from one geek to another that you'll help the free desktop 3D printer movement grow :)
  1. You must promise to participate in a 3D printer party organised by this group or another so that you can pass on your skills of how to build, own and operate a 3D printer.
  1. You must promise to publish any of your 3D designs in the open with a license that will allow anyone else to reuse, share or re-design.
  1. You'll need to come and pick the printer up, it is in London.  Either via car, which is easiest, or if you are going to take it via public transport you'll need two people to carry it (it is rather cumbersome and requires two people on each side to carry) - you will NOT get it on a plane.

To summarise the points above, you need to 'promise' to participate in the #pif3D movement and ethos to the best of your ability :)

So if you agree to all of the above I'll be taking applications in the form of a public statement in the comments below, stating why you want the printer (how you'll use it to further the 3D printer movement; what things you'd like to printer other than more printers and who you will make another printer for to give away along with their circumstances for what they want to do with their printer), and also where you will keep the printer - preference will be for those who can make the printer available in a public space be that a University department or a hack lab.  Of course, you'll have help and support from the #pif3D community in all of the above :)
