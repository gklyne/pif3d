As the name suggests (pay it forward 3D printing), we are looking to give away free RepRap parts to anyone who wants to host a pif3D build party(1).  Remember when you were a kid and used to build legos with your friends, well welcome to the next best thing for adults ;-)

(1) = Terms and conditions:
  * We give you the plastic parts (printed from one of the already existing pif3D printers)
  * We send along a couple of pif3D members who have built printers before (to walk you through the build).
  * You host the party (usually a 24 hour build) with pizza and beer ;-)
  * You buy the nuts, bolts and stepper motors (Â£300), see PartsList
  * You agree to print off another set of parts (once your printer is working) for someone else who wants to host a build party.
  * You encourage your friends that you'll give them the parts if they host another build party!

## Please sign up below ##
**If you could please include what (if any) institution you are affiliated with along with when you think you'll be able to host the build party.  It takes a couple of weeks to buy in the electronics and nuts/bolts, see PartsList**

_We are encouraging University departments to be the first to have these printers as we hope they can act as hubs where people can come and learn to build their own printers.  Also we think there are great implications for these machines being able to print scientific apparatus for research as well as produce interesting teaching material for learning, etc._
