Project tag = **pif3D**


This project site is for:

  1. Organising "#pif3D Printer Build Parties" (see below for when the next party is going to happen)
  1. Helping people who want to own their own 3D printers to buy parts from UK suppliers (though you don't need to buy a printer to participate in a build party!).
  1. Organising the community of printers into bigger builds! - Henry T. Ford had no idea what could be achieved with a multiplexed version of his Ford Assembly line process!

_NOTE: This site is only for organising builds for the 'pay it forward 3D" printing scheme, any other information related to RepRap should be placed on their wiki:_

What kinds of "things" can a 3D printer print?
  * See for yourself, [here is a digital library of objects you can print right now once you have a 3D printer](http://www.thingiverse.com/).

# When is the the next '3D Printer Build Party'? #

We are planning to have another 3D print party on the:

  * TBA University for the Creative Arts... 3D printing the new sewing machine?!
  * TBA Manchester University Computer Science... an freshers group worth joining!

We are busy printing up new parts to give away at this party. If you are interested in building your own printer and being gifted the printed parts (50% of the parts you need to build a 3D printer) please see [your responsibilities for 'paying it forward'](http://code.google.com/p/pif3d/wiki/SignUp) as well as the [costs and suppliers](http://code.google.com/p/pif3d/wiki/PartsList) that you will need to buy the other 50% of the parts for the build.  We of course gift you the printable parts, skills, fun and support as you become a 3D printer yourself!

## Previous 3D Printer Build Parties ##

  * [19/20 March 2011 at InSpace Gallery, Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, UK](http://code.google.com/p/pif3d/wiki/EdinburghBuild)
  * [5th/6th February 2011 at CASA, University College London, London, UK](LondonBuild.md)
  * Various weekends in 2010 at JISC, London (to build the RepStrap <-- mother of printed parts for #pif3D printers)

# Why should I be interested in 3D printing? #
